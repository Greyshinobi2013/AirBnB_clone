## Command interpreter

A command interpreter, also called a command-line interpreter (CLI) or shell, is a program that lets you interact with your computer by typing text commands. It's like giving your computer instructions one line at a time, instead of clicking through menus with a mouse.

### How it works?
Starting the Command Interpreter:
    - **Windows**: Press the Windows key + R, type "cmd" and press Enter. This opens the Command Prompt.
    - **macOS/Linux**: Open the Terminal application. You can usually find it in the Utilities folder within Applications.
### How to use it?

Once you've opened the command interpreter, you'll see a blinking cursor and some text showing the current directory (location) on your computer. This is called the prompt.
Type your command at the prompt and press Enter. The command interpreter will try to understand what you typed and carry out the instruction.

### Example

- Listing files: Type `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (macOS/Linux) and press Enter to see a list of files in the current directory.
- Changing directories: Use the `cd` command followed by the directory name to navigate to a different folder. For example, `cd documents` will change the current directory to your Documents folder.
- Getting information about a file: Type `dir /w /q filename.txt` (Windows) or `ls -l filename.txt` (macOS/Linux) to see details about a specific file.
- Copying a file: Use the `copy sourcefilename destinationfilename` command (Windows) or `cp sourcefilename destinationfilename` (macOS/Linux) to copy a file from one location to another.
